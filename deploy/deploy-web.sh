# Atomically publish a new Next.js static export into the nginx-served webout dir.
#
# Why not `rm -rf webout/* && tar xzf`:
#   1. It leaves the directory EMPTY for a moment — anything requested in that
#      window 404s, and a Mini App in that window shows "This page couldn't load".
#   2. Next.js chunk filenames are content-hashed. A client that loaded the old
#      HTML still asks for the OLD chunk names. Deleting them strands every open
#      session until the user gets fresh HTML — which Telegram's cached webview
#      may not do for a long time.
#
# So: overlay the new build on top (never empty the dir), swap the entry files in
# with atomic renames, and only then retire files that both (a) are absent from the
# new build and (b) are old enough that no live session should still want them.
